- What is static code analysis? What does it do for us?
    - Static Code Analysis is the process of examining the source code of a program without executing it. This analysis is performed using tools that scan the code for potential errors, code smells, security vulnerabilities, and adherence to coding standards.
    Benefits:
    - Early Detection of Issues: Finds bugs, vulnerabilities, and code smells early in the development process.
    - Improved Code Quality: Ensures code conforms to best practices and coding standards.
    - Increased Security: Identifies security vulnerabilities before they can be exploited.
    - Maintainability: Promotes clean, readable, and maintainable code.
    - Efficiency: Saves time and effort in manual code reviews by automating the analysis process.

- What is New Code definition?
    - New Code Definition refers to the criteria set to identify what constitutes "new" or "changed" code in a project. This is crucial for tracking and analyzing only the new or modified code to ensure it meets quality standards without re-analyzing the entire codebase.

- What is Quality Gate?
    - A Quality Gate is a set of conditions that a codebase must meet to be considered of acceptable quality. It includes metrics such as code coverage, the number of bugs, code smells, vulnerabilities, and duplications.

- What are Maintenance issues?
    - Maintenance Issues are problems in the code that make it difficult to maintain, understand, or extend. These issues often relate to code complexity, readability, and adherence to coding standards.

- What are Security issues?
    - Security Issues are vulnerabilities in the code that could be exploited to compromise the systemâ€™s integrity, confidentiality, or availability.

- What are Reliability issues?
    - Reliability Issues are defects in the code that can lead to software failure, crashes, or unexpected behavior. These issues impact the stability and robustness of the application.
